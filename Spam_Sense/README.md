## 📝 About

This project was developed as part of my learning journey as a third-year B.Tech student interested in practical applications of machine learning. The app uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, and provides both a Streamlit web interface and a basic Tkinter GUI.

## 🚀 Features

- **Instant Spam Detection**: Paste any email text and get an immediate prediction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Modern web UI with Streamlit and a simple Tkinter desktop app.
- **Machine Learning Powered**: Trained on a labeled dataset of real-world emails.
- **Custom Security Tips**: Offers actionable advice to improve your email safety awareness.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `app.py` — Streamlit web application for interactive spam detection
- `Spam Detector.ipynb` — Data analysis, model training, and evaluation notebook
- `spam.pkl` — Trained spam classification model (generated after running the notebook)
- `vectorizer.pkl` — Text vectorizer (generated after running the notebook)
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies

## 🖥️ How it Works

1. User enters/pastes email content.
2. The text is vectorized using a trained `CountVectorizer`.
3. The model predicts whether the input is spam or ham (not spam).
4. The app displays the result along with security tips.
