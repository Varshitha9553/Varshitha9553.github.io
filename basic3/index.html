    <p >We're here to guide you through the basics of HTML and CSS, so you can understand how the web works and even you can create your own cool sites someday!</p> 
    <p>HTML and CSS are two languages that work together to create everything that you see when you look at something on the internet. HTML is the raw data that a webpage is built out of. All the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML. CSS is what adds style to those plain elements. HTML puts information on a webpage, and CSS positions that information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!</p>

<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Features of html</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>It is easy to learn and easy to use</p></li>
<li><p>It is platform independent</p></li>
<li><p>Images,videos and audio can be added to a web page.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypertext can  be added to the text</p></li>
<li><p>It is a markup language</p></li>
<p><html page structure:</p>
<p>The basic structure of an HTML page is shown below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.</p>
<p>There are different tags for:</p>

  <pre><table><tr>
            <th>S.No</th>
            <th>Tags</th>
            <th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
            <td>1.</td>
            <td>< p >...< /p ></td>
            <td>The tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tags.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
            <td>2.</td>
            <td>< b>… < /b></td>
            <td>The bold tag in HTML is used to specify the bold text without any extra importance</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
            <td>3.</td>
            <td>< br></td>
            <td>The break tag inserts a single carriage return or breaks in the document. This element has no end tag.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
            <td>4.</td>
            <td>< !--....--></td>
            <td>The comment tag is used to insert comments in the HTML code.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
            <td>5.</td>
            <td>< div>  < /div></td>
            <td>The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content in the web page</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
            <td>6.</td>
            <td>< pre> < /pre></td>
            <td>The pre tag in HTML is used to define the block of preformatted text which preserves the text spaces.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>

            <td>7.</td>
            <td>< table> < /table></td>
            <td>HTML Table, various ways to implement it, & will also understand its usage through the examples.

HTML Table is an arrangement of data in rows and columns, or possibly in a more complex structure.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
        
            <td>8.</td>
            <td>< td> < /td></td>
            <td>The table data tag is used to define a standard cell in an HTML table.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
        
        
            <td>9.</td>
            <td>< u>< /u></td>
            <td>The underline tag in HTML stands for underline, and it’s used to underline the text enclosed within the tag.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
        
       
            <td>10.</td>
            <td>< span> < /span></td>
            <td>The HTML span element is a generic inline container for inline elements and content.</td>
		</tr>

    </table></pre>

<li><h4>Attributes:</h4><p>HTML tags can have attributes, which provide additional information about an element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag and typically consist of a name and a value.</p></li></ol></div>

<h1>CSS</h1>
<p>
CSS is a language used to style web pages.
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.</p><p> It controls the layout, formatting, and appearance of elements on a web page, such as fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning.</p><p> CSS allows web developers to separate the structure of a document (HTML) from its presentation, making it easier to maintain and update the styling of a website across multiple pages.</p>

<p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

<h2>Selectors</h2>
<p>Selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style.</p>
<p>They can target elements by their tag name, class, ID, attributes, or relationship to other elements.</p>
<p>Examples include element selectors (e.g., p for paragraphs), class selectors (e.g., .class-name), and ID selectors </p>
<h2>Properties and values</h2>
<div><p>CSS rules consist of one or more declarations, each containing a property and a value.</p></div>
<div><p>Properties define the visual aspects to be changed (e.g., color, font-size, margin)</p></div>
<div><p>Values specify how the properties should be styled (e.g., red, 16px, 20px)</p></div>

<h2>Types of styling in CSS</h2>
<p>CSS can be applied in three ways:</p>
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/csspages/images/types-of-css.png" class="center">
<div><p><b>Inline styling </b>: CSS is applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute.</p></div>
<div><p><b>Internal styling</b> : CSS is defined within the style element in the head section of an HTML document.
selector { property:value}</div></p>
<p><b>External styling</b> : CSS is written in separate CSS files and linked to HTML documents using the link////// element.</h2>
